# Random Password Generator
Simple password generator written in python. This program is ideally used as a quick method to generate passwords to use when creating accounts, as well as adding them to a file such as a password vault or a text file (please don't use a text file). It is text based so it can be run on any machine. The characters generated are universally valid for account creation on most websites and should work normally.

The password generated consists of the following:

A-Z

a-z

1-9

!@#$%^&*()_+-={}[].,\<>?"':;
